1. We can use Runge-Kutta method to approximate the voltages. Although, there are more steps when using the Runge-Kutta method it is beneficial because we don't have to do the calculation on bigger timesteps. So, it could be more efficient in terms of computation. We could also make the timestep larger when the system is stable and reduce it when the system is not.

2. Instead of manually changing the alpha randomly, we can train a AI model to predict the most optimal value for alpha. This could be done by using linear regression or a neural network. Although using AI in this case seems inefficient. Alpha could be determined using a formula depending on how big the margin of error is.

3. We can implement the cost function by using newton's method. Instead of adjusting the current iteratively with a heuristic, this method would use derivatives to converge more quickly to the correct value. This approach can provide faster convergence by guessing better values of current based on the slope of the error function. With this approach, there is no need for an AI model to adjust the heuristic. Since the guessing will take less computational power, we can reduce the length of each timestep to make the graph even more accurate. 

4. The project could have used a more modern graphics library instead of OpenGL. The structure of the project is good, the component interface class helps user integrate new components without any problem. I would use newton's method for the cost function as it seems much more accurate and efficient, rather than randomly guessing the heuristic. C++ is a good language for this project since we do a lot of calculation in the cost function.
